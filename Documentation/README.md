# Project-Keyboard-Warrior
A speed typing website that's capable of tracking your progress in the format of a game.

Feel free to add more to the list if you guys want! Here's some I had in mind.

## List of planned features:
### Basic layout
* Navigation bar
* Practice page
* Timed trial page
* Leaderboard page
* Account page

### Basic features
* Working speed typing game
* Account creation and personal record tracking
* Real-time leaderboard updates

### Cosmetic features
* HP Bar
    - Since this is going to have 'game' aspect, we'll add an HP management system. Every player starts with 10 HP. Every time a user misplaces a letter, they get -1 HP, but if they manage to spell a full world correctly, they back +1 HP.
* Custom Logo? (Would be cool)
* Subtle sound effects for specific situations
    - i.e spelling a word correctly (slashing sound), taking damage ("oof")
