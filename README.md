# Project-Keyboard-Warrior
A speed typing website that's capable of tracking your progress in the format of a game.

Feel free to add more to the list if you guys want! Here's some I had in mind.

## List of planned features:
### Basic layout
* Navigation bar
* Practice page
* Timed trial page
* Leaderboard page
* Account page

### Basic features
* Working speed typing game
* Account creation and personal record tracking
* Real-time leaderboard updates

### Cosmetic features
* HP Bar
    - Since this is going to have 'game' aspect, we'll add an HP management system. Every player starts with 10 HP. Every time a user misplaces a letter, they get -1 HP, but if they manage to spell a full world correctly, they back +1 HP.
* Custom Logo? (Would be cool)
* Subtle sound effects for specific situations
    - i.e spelling a word correctly (slashing sound), taking damage ("oof")
* Japanese Themed website
    - ***Best not to focus on this too much for simplicity's sake but it could be given focus once we get our backend working. Just wanted to put it here before my brain rots.***
    - Think along the lines of fonts that have a "brush stroke" feel to them. The backgrounds and tab elements would look like they were dry painted. I'll provide some sample images to convey it better. 

        * ![Example of brush strokes](https://www.freejapanesefont.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/kouzan-gyousho.png)
        * Link to [font in image](https://www.freejapanesefont.com/kouzan-semi-cursive-brush-font/). Might be able to use .otf fonts but needs some testing.

        * ![Example of theme](https://study.com/cimages/videopreview/jay1dpovbu.jpg)
        * An example of the theme. Something simple.
        * We could also make our own drawn assets if we wanted to; I have CSP. I might try if I don't feel lazy af or am not crunched for time.
    - I'm also thinking to model the sound effects around this theme as well as free music we can plan in the background, depending on the tab we're on.
        * Relaxing oriental music when viewing statistics or on home page
        * And a more fight oriented instrumental for the actual timed trial

### Example website(s) for inspiration
* [Keybr.com](https://www.keybr.com/)
    - Literally has all the basic features that we'd need for this project to work. Now take that and add ~~ramen~~ some traditional Japanese style artwork as its skin.
